# Cloud Foundry Application Discovery to canonical form

This is the title of the enhancement. Keep it simple and descriptive. A good
title can help communicate what the enhancement is and should be considered as
part of any review.

The YAML `title` should be lowercased and spaces/punctuation should be
replaced with `-`.

To get started with this template:
1. **Pick a domain.** Find the appropriate domain to discuss your enhancement.
1. **Make a copy of this template.** Copy this template into the directory for
   the domain.
1. **Fill out the "overview" sections.** This includes the Summary and
   Motivation sections. These should be easy and explain why the community
   should desire this enhancement.
1. **Create a PR.** Assign it to folks with expertise in that domain to help
   sponsor the process.
1. **Merge at each milestone.** Merge when the design is able to transition to a
   new status (provisional, implementable, implemented, etc.). View anything
   marked as `provisional` as an idea worth exploring in the future, but not
   accepted as ready to execute. Anything marked as `implementable` should
   clearly communicate how an enhancement is coded up and delivered. If an
   enhancement describes a new deployment topology or platform, include a
   logical description for the deployment, and how it handles the unique aspects
   of the platform. Aim for single topic PRs to keep discussions focused. If you
   disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR with suggested
   changes.

The `Metadata` section above is intended to support the creation of tooling
around the enhancement process.

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created

## Open Questions [optional]

This is where to call out areas of the design that require closure before deciding
to implement the design.  For instance,
 > 1. This requires exposing previously private resources which contain sensitive
  information.  Can we do this?

## Summary

Cloud Foundry (CF) is a platform-as-a-service solution that simplifies application deployment by abstracting infrastructure concerns. Applications on CF are deployed using manifests, which are YAML files specifying application properties, resource allocations, environment variables, and service bindings. These manifests provide a structured and declarative way to define the runtime and platform configurations required for an application.

MTA is an IBM research project with the goal to provide tools to migrate applications to other platforms, particularly Kubernetes. One of the use cases of MTA is to migrate Cloud Foundry applications to Kubernetes, but users have been struggling with the template language used to capture the Kubernetes resources, as it is not well known and requires an additional effort to master, compared to other templating languages.

## Motivation

The challenge brought by the templating language severely impacts the usability and acceptance of the tool. Thus the existence of this enhancement to provide a similar tool to MTA, extensible, and that improves on the templating engine, so that it offers a pluggable design that can be used to implement well known templating engines.

### Goals

* Identify and understand Cloud Foundry Application manifests (v3) fields.
* Extract and process Cloud Foundry application manifest into a new canonical form, capturing the intent of the original field value and
  with the foresight of the future application of the given field in a Kubernetes platform.
* Provide documentation for developers to understand the relationship between the original manifest and resulting canonical manifest.

### Non-Goals

* Transformation provider for Kubernetes using Helm Charts.

## Proposal

To migrate applications from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes, it is essential to translate these manifests into an intermediate format, or canonical form, that captures the intent and configuration of the CF manifest. This intermediate manifest serves as a bridge, retaining critical deployment configurations while adapting them to Kubernetes-native practices. The format needs to be designed as platform-agnostic and compatible with multiple templating engines like Helm or Ansible, enabling flexibility in how the deployment configurations are generated and managed.

The following table depicts the relationship between the Cloud Foundry Application manifest fields and the proposed location in the canonical form manifest.

### Space specification {#space-specification}

| Name | Mapped (Y/N) | Canonical Form | Description |
| ----- | :---: | ----- | ----- |
| **applications** | N |  | Direct mapping to a slice of canonical form manifests, each one representing the discovery results of a CF application. See [app-level specification](#application-specification) |
| **space** | Y | Metadata.Space | See [metadata specification](#metadata-specification).This field is only populated at runtime. |
| **version** | N |  |  |

### Application specification {#application-specification}

| Name | Mapped  | Canonical Form | Comments |
| ----- | :---: | ----- | ----- |
| **name** | Y | Metadata.Name | Name is derived from the application’s Name field, which is stored in the metadata of the discovery manifest, following Kubernetes structured resources format.
See [metadata specification](#metadata-specification). |
| **buildpacks** | *N* |  | These fields in CF specify how to build your application (e.g., "nodejs\_buildpack", "java\_buildpack"). The canonical form should focus on "what" to deploy, not "how" to build it |
| **docker** | Y | Process.Image | The value of the docker image pullspec is captured for each \`Process\` in the Image field. See [process specification](#process-level-configuration). |
| **env** | Y | Env |  |
| **no-route** | Y | Routes | Processes will have no route information in the canonical form manifest. See [process specification](#process-specification). |
| **processes** | Y | Processes | See [process specification](#process-specification) |
| **random-route** | Y | Routes | See [route specification](#route-specification). |
| **default-route** | Y |  | The default behavior for CF Applications is to define a route based on the name of the application and its domain ([https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html\#default-push](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html#default-push)).
Example:
https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/multiple-processes.html |

| **services** | Y | Services | See [service specification](#service-specification). |
| **sidecars** | Y | Sidecars | See [sidecar specification](#sidecar-specification). |
| **metadata** | Y | Metadata | See [metadata specification](#metadata-specification). |

| **command** | Y | Command | Command to run this sidecar |
| **Memory** | Y | Memory | (Optional) The amount of memory allocated for the sidecar. |

### Service specification {#service-specification}

Maps to Spec.Services in the canonical form. Only \`name\` and \`parameters\` fields are captured since \`binding\_name\` is only used when defining a service and not applicable to a CF application.

| Name | Mapped  | Canonical Form | Description |

Note: In CF, limit for all instances of the **web** process; |
| **memory** | Y | Memory | The value at the application level defines the default memory requirements for all processes in the application, when not specified by the process itself. The discovery process will consolidate the amount of memory specific to each process based on the information either in the application or the process fields. Example: 128MB unit of measurement: `B`, `K`, `KB`, `M`, `MB`, `G`, `GB`, `T`, or `TB` in upper case or lower case Note: In CF, limit for all instances of the **web** process; |

If the application has globally defined routes, those processes of web type (worker type are not meant to have any port opened) will inherit the routes defined in this field.
Examples:
\---

	...
	routes:
	\- route: example.com
	  protocol: http2
	\- route: www.example.com/foo
	\- route: tcp-example.com:1234

### User Stories [optional]

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

What are the caveats to the implementation? What are some important details that
didn't come across above. Go in to as much detail as necessary here. This might
be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.

### Security, Risks, and Mitigations

**Carefully think through the security implications for this change**

What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate. Think broadly. How
will this impact the broader OKD ecosystem? Does this work in a managed services
environment that has many tenants?

How will security be reviewed and by whom? How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside your immediate sub-project.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations).

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure this
is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade in order to...
  -  keep previous behavior?
  - make use of the enhancement?
